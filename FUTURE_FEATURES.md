# üöÄ Future Features & Enhancements

## üîÑ Remote Node Restart (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Feature Description:**
Add ability to remotely restart Nosana nodes directly from the app via SSH connection.

**Requirements Needed:**
1. **Server Connection Details**
   - IP Address or Hostname for each server
   - SSH Port (usually 22)
   - SSH Username

2. **SSH Authentication Method**
   - Option A: SSH Private Key (Recommended)
   - Option B: Password

3. **Exact Restart Command**
   - The exact command to restart Nosana (e.g., `nosana start`, `systemctl restart nosana`, etc.)

4. **Node-to-Server Mapping**
   - Which node addresses are on which servers

5. **Sudo Requirements**
   - Does the restart command need `sudo`?
   - Is passwordless sudo enabled?

**Implementation Plan:**
- Backend: Python `paramiko` library for SSH
- Encrypted credential storage in database
- API endpoint: `POST /api/nodes/{node_id}/restart`
- Frontend: Restart button (‚ü≥) on each node card
- Confirmation dialog before restart
- Rate limiting: 5 restarts per hour per node
- Audit logging of all restart attempts

**Additional Commands to Consider:**
- Stop node
- Check node logs
- View detailed node status
- Update node software
