# Job Payment Notifications - Fixed to Use Dashboard Data

## Issue
Job completion notifications were showing **incorrect payment amounts** because they were using **formula-based calculations** instead of actual payment data from the Nosana dashboard.

## Root Cause
The previous implementation:
```python
# OLD CODE - WRONG
nos_payment = calculate_job_payment(duration_seconds, nos_price, gpu_type=gpu_type)
# Used formulas like: hourly_rate √ó duration_hours / nos_price
```

This calculated payments based on assumed hourly rates ($0.176/hr for 3090, etc.) rather than scraping the **actual payment** shown on the dashboard.

## Solution Implemented
Now the system **scrapes the actual payment** directly from the Nosana dashboard's price column:

### New Function: `scrape_latest_job_payment()`
```python
async def scrape_latest_job_payment(node_address: str) -> Optional[float]:
    """
    Scrape the ACTUAL payment amount from Nosana dashboard for the most recent job
    
    Returns:
        Actual payment amount in USD from dashboard's price column
    """
```

### How It Works
1. When a job completes, the system detects the status change
2. **Scrapes the Nosana dashboard** for the most recent job
3. Extracts the **actual payment** from the price column (e.g., $0.176)
4. Converts to NOS using current token price
5. Sends notification with **real payment data**

### What Changed

**Before:**
```
‚úÖ Job Completed
Node X - 55m 8s
üí∞ Payment: 0.34 NOS (~$0.16 USD)  ‚ùå CALCULATED - WRONG
```

**After:**
```
‚úÖ Job Completed
Node X - 55m 8s ‚Ä¢ $0.176 USD (~0.37 NOS)  ‚úÖ FROM DASHBOARD - CORRECT
```

## Notifications Enhanced

### Firebase Push Notification (Lock Screen)
Now includes:
- ‚úÖ Job Completed
- ‚úÖ Duration (e.g., 55m 8s)
- ‚úÖ **Actual payment from dashboard** ($0.176 USD ~0.37 NOS)

**Shows on lock screen with HIGH priority**

### Telegram Bot Notification
Enhanced message with:
```
üéâ Job Completed - Node Name

‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 55m 8s
üí∞ Payment: $0.176 USD (~0.37 NOS)

[View Dashboard]
```

## Technical Details

### Scraping Process
1. **Target**: `https://dashboard.nosana.com/host/{node_address}`
2. **Element**: Table ‚Üí First Row (most recent job) ‚Üí Column 4 (price)
3. **Parse**: Extract numeric value from price column
4. **Return**: Actual USD payment amount

### No Calculations
- ‚ùå NO hourly rate formulas
- ‚ùå NO GPU type assumptions
- ‚ùå NO duration √ó rate calculations
- ‚úÖ Direct scraping only
- ‚úÖ Actual dashboard values

### Error Handling
If scraping fails:
- Logs warning
- Notification sent without payment info
- User still gets job completion alert

## Testing

### Test Script
```bash
cd /app/backend
python test_payment_scraping.py
```

### Expected Output
```
Testing Payment Scraping for Node: 9hsWPkJUBiDQnc2p7dKi2gMKHp6LwscA6Z5qAF8NGsyV
‚úÖ Successfully scraped payment: $0.176 USD
This is the ACTUAL payment from the dashboard's price column
NO calculations or formulas used - direct scraping only
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Accurate Payments**: Shows real amounts users actually received
2. **No Assumptions**: Doesn't rely on GPU type or rate tables
3. **Dashboard Match**: Notification payment matches what user sees on dashboard
4. **Real-Time**: Scrapes fresh data when job completes
5. **Lock Screen**: Payment info now shows on lock screen notifications too

## Important Notes

### Telegram Bot Limitations
- Telegram bot messages depend on Telegram app's notification settings
- For reliable lock screen alerts, users should:
  - Set Telegram to HIGH priority in phone settings
  - Enable "Show on lock screen"
  - Disable battery optimization for Telegram

### Firebase Push (Recommended)
- Firebase push notifications work more reliably on lock screen
- HIGH priority delivery
- Don't depend on external app settings
- Now include full payment details

## Files Modified

- `/app/backend/server.py`:
  - Added `scrape_latest_job_payment()` function
  - Updated job completion notification logic (lines 2078-2108)
  - Enhanced Firebase push notification with payment (lines 2123-2131)
  - Telegram notification already had payment info

## Status

‚úÖ **FIXED** - Job completion notifications now show actual payment amounts from Nosana dashboard  
‚úÖ **TESTED** - Scraping function verified working  
‚úÖ **DEPLOYED** - Backend restarted with new code
