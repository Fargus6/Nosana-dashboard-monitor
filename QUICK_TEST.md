# 🎯 Quick Test Instructions

## You need to test the new job notifications!

### What I've built:
✅ Job duration tracking (automatically times jobs)
✅ Payment calculation (converts to NOS based on live price)
✅ Enhanced Telegram notifications with duration + payment info

### To see how it looks in Telegram:

**Step 1:** Open Telegram and send `/start` to your bot
- Your bot token is configured: `7450691415...`
- Find your bot in Telegram (check @BotFather if you forgot the username)

**Step 2:** Run the test script
```bash
cd /app/backend && python3 test_job_notifications_simple.py
```

**Step 3:** The script will:
- Auto-detect your chat ID
- Send 5 sample job notifications with different durations
- Show you exactly how the enhanced notifications look

### What you'll see:
```
🎉 Job Completed - Node Alpha

⏱️ Duration: 25m 0s
💰 Payment: 0.42 NOS (~$0.19 USD)

[View Dashboard]
```

### That's it!
Once you send `/start` to the bot and run the script, you'll receive 5 test notifications showing:
- Different job durations (90s, 6min, 25min, 1hr, 2hr)
- Calculated payments in NOS and USD
- Direct dashboard links

Then you can tell me if you like the format or want any changes! 🚀
