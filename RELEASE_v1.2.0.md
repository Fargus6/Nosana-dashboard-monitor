# 🚀 Nosana Node Monitor v1.2.0 - Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Stability**: High

---

## 🎯 Major Updates

### 💰 Accurate Payment Notifications (NEW!)

**What's New:**
- Job completion notifications now show **actual payment amounts** from Nosana dashboard
- **NO more formula-based calculations** - direct scraping only
- Payments match exactly what you see on the dashboard

**Before:**
```
✅ Job Completed
Node X - 55m 8s
💰 Payment: 0.34 NOS (~$0.16 USD)  ❌ CALCULATED - WRONG
```

**After:**
```
✅ Job Completed  
Node X - 55m 8s • $0.176 USD (~0.37 NOS)  ✅ FROM DASHBOARD - CORRECT
```

**Technical Details:**
- Scrapes `https://dashboard.nosana.com/host/{address}` when job completes
- Extracts actual payment from price column
- Converts USD to NOS using current token price
- No GPU type assumptions needed

**Affected Notifications:**
- ✅ Firebase Push (lock screen)
- ✅ Telegram Bot messages
- ✅ Both show accurate payments now

---

### 🔒 Auto-Logout Issue Fixed

**Problem Solved:**
- Users were getting logged out randomly
- Sessions lost after backend restart
- "Unauthorized" errors with valid tokens

**Root Cause Found:**
- Missing `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` file
- New random key generated on each restart
- All JWT tokens became invalid

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added permanent `SECRET_KEY` to `.env`
- ✅ Tokens survive backend restarts
- ✅ Sessions persist reliably
- ✅ No more random logouts

**Additional Improvements:**
- Enhanced token verification with 3-retry mechanism
- Periodic token refresh every 5 minutes
- Smart error handling (only logout on actual auth failures)
- Network errors don't trigger logout

---

### ⚡ Server Sleep Prevention Enhanced

**Problem Solved:**
- Servers going to sleep after inactivity
- "Server waking up" messages
- Delayed first request after idle period

**Solution:**
- ✅ Keep-alive ping every 30 seconds (increased frequency)
- ✅ Runs even when user not logged in
- ✅ Auto-retry 3 times if server sleeping
- ✅ Transparent wake-up with status indicator

**Technical Details:**
- Frontend pings `/api/health` every 30 seconds
- Backend health endpoint also pings Nosana service
- All services stay awake continuously
- User sees "waking" status briefly if needed
