This trajectory details a robust development and bug-fixing phase. Initial tasks involved iterative logo redesigns and comprehensive updates across various formats, followed by crucial UI/UX enhancements like Cyber theme adjustments and PWA auto-update implementation. Significant effort was dedicated to app stability, addressing persistent auto-logout issues by identifying and fixing a critical vulnerability related to the  regeneration on backend restarts. Notification systems were refined for iOS compatibility (PWA requirement) and expanded to include Telegram bot integration for critical alerts (low SOL balance, disconnected nodes). Balance display issues were resolved by directly querying the Solana blockchain. Finally, server sleep prevention mechanisms were implemented, and documentation was consistently updated.

The Nosana Node Monitor is a PWA designed to track Nosana AI network nodes, displaying their status and offering alerts. The user aimed to enhance its stability, user experience, and notification capabilities.

**Implemented features based on recent requests:**
1.  **Logo Redesign:** Iterative refinements to the app logo, including specific N shape, green palette, and Nosana Node Monitor text.
2.  **Cyber Theme UI:** Adjusted node names, buttons, and icons to white for improved visibility.
3.  **App Stability & Auto-Logout:** Fixed auto-logout by ensuring a static  in backend, enhancing  resilience, and implementing constant keep-alive pings.
4.  **Job Started Notifications:** Backend logic () updated to correctly trigger job started notifications for nodes transitioning from 'queue' to 'running'.
5.  **PWA Auto-Update:** Implemented a system for automatic app updates via  and .
6.  **Lock Screen Notifications:** Enhanced push notifications with higher priority, screen wake-up, and specific options for lock screen display on mobile devices.
7.  **iOS Notifications:** Identified and addressed iOS-specific requirements, adding in-app warnings for users not having the app Added to Home Screen as a PWA.
8.  **Wallet Balance Display:** Corrected incorrect NOS and SOL balance display by fetching NOS balance directly from the Solana blockchain, improving accuracy and reliability.
9.  **Server Sleep Prevention:** Enhanced keep-alive mechanisms and the backend health check endpoint to prevent services from going to sleep due to inactivity.
10. **Critical SOL Balance Notification:** Implemented a Telegram bot integration to send critical alerts for low SOL balance (<0.006 SOL) and disconnected nodes, offering a more reliable notification channel alongside mobile push.
11. **Settings Menu Visibility:** Improved the visibility and discoverability of the Settings menu (Bell icon) in the frontend.
12. **Mobile UI for Telegram:** Adjusted the Settings modal styling to be scrollable on mobile, ensuring the Telegram integration section is visible.
13. **Automated Testing & Documentation:** Set up daily automated backend/frontend tests and updated  and created various new documentation files (e.g., PWA_UPDATE_SYSTEM.md, TELEGRAM_BOT_INTEGRATION.md).

<current_work>
The immediate work involved stabilizing the application and enhancing its notification capabilities. The AI engineer thoroughly addressed the auto-logout issue by identifying that the  for JWT tokens was being regenerated on every backend restart due to its absence in . This was fixed by adding a static  to  and restarting services, preventing token invalidation.

Concurrently, the Telegram bot integration was completed. This included:
1.  Installing  and adding the  to .
2.  Creating  to handle bot logic and storing chat IDs.
3.  Integrating Telegram notification sending into , specifically for critical low SOL balance (<0.006 SOL) and disconnected node alerts.
4.  Adding API endpoints in  for linking Telegram accounts.
5.  Implementing a persistent supervisor configuration () to ensure the Telegram bot runs continuously and auto-restarts.
6.  Developing frontend UI in  for linking Telegram accounts within the Settings modal.
7.  Addressing mobile display issues for the Telegram section by making the Settings modal scrollable on smaller screens.
8.  Verifying the bot's functionality and responsiveness to commands.

All these changes have been implemented, tested, and documented.
