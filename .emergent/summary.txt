The AI engineer's work transitioned from initial bug fixes and core feature enhancements to implementing a sophisticated earnings statistics system. Key achievements include stabilizing the app (auto-logout, server sleep), integrating Telegram for critical alerts, and implementing PWA auto-updates. The most recent phase focused heavily on developing and debugging the node earnings statistics feature, which involved iterative refinements of the payment calculation formula based on user feedback and direct scraping of the Nosana dashboard. This led to understanding that payment is hourly and dependent on GPU type, with specific rates confirmed through web scraping. The current state is poised to correct the payment calculation using these newly identified rates.

<product_requirements>
The Nosana Node Monitor PWA tracks Nosana AI network nodes, displaying status and offering alerts. The user requested improvements in stability, UX, and notifications.
**Implemented features:** Logo redesign, Cyber theme UI adjustments, auto-logout fix via static  and keep-alive pings, PWA auto-update, enhanced lock screen and iOS notifications, accurate NOS/SOL balance display from Solana, server sleep prevention, and critical low SOL/disconnected node alerts via Telegram bot. The latest major feature is a detailed node earnings statistics system, displaying daily (yesterday on card), monthly, and yearly earnings per node in a separate tab, calculated based on a rolling year, with calendar-aligned months.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Core FastAPI backend.
    - **Summary**: Handles API endpoints, authentication, node monitoring, and notifications.
    - **Changes**: Modified  model to include  and . Added  function. Updated  to store job start times and trigger enhanced Telegram notifications upon job completion. Added  function and integrated it into job completion logic. Introduced , ,  API endpoints. The  function was repeatedly modified to refine payment logic, first to a fixed rate, then to an hourly rate dependent on .
- ****: Environment variables.
    - **Summary**: Stores sensitive configurations.
    - **Changes**:  and  added in previous work.
- ****: New file.
    - **Summary**: Runs the Telegram bot, handles  and  commands, and stores/retrieves Telegram chat IDs from MongoDB.
    - **Changes**: Created as part of Telegram integration.
- ****: New file.
    - **Summary**: Supervisor configuration to ensure the Telegram bot runs persistently.
    - **Changes**: Created to manage .
- ****: Main React UI.
    - **Summary**: Renders node cards, settings, and other UI components.
    - **Changes**: Added state variables for earnings (, , , ). Implemented  and  functions. Modified  to fetch initial earnings data. Updated node card to display yesterdays earnings" and include a "View Earnings Statistics" button. Implemented a new `StatisticsModal` component for detailed earnings. Fixed `secureStorage.getItem` to `secureStorage.get`.
- **`/app/*.md` files**: Numerous documentation files.
    - **Summary**: Document fixes, features, and troubleshooting.
    - **Changes**: `JOB_PAYMENT_NOTIFICATIONS.md`, `EARNINGS_STATISTICS_SYSTEM.md`, `TESTING_JOB_NOTIFICATIONS.md`, `QUICK_TEST.md`, `TEST_YOUR_NODE.md`, `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`, `FEATURE_ANNOUNCEMENT.md` were created. `README.md` was updated for Telegram bot instructions and refined to remove specific payment calculation details.
- **`/app/backend/populate_sample_earnings.py` / `regenerate_realistic_earnings.py` / `fix_job_frequency.py` / `generate_final_realistic_data.py`**: New testing scripts.
    - **Summary**: Used to populate MongoDB with sample earnings data for testing the frontend display of statistics.
    - **Changes**: Created and iteratively modified to generate more realistic and accurate sample data based on refined payment formulas.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved extensively debugging and refining the node earnings statistics feature. The backend was updated to save earnings data upon job completion and expose API endpoints for daily, monthly, and yearly statistics. The frontend `App.js` was modified to display "yesterdays earnings on node cards and present detailed statistics in a dedicated modal.

During this process, several issues were encountered and resolved:
1.  **Empty Statistics Display**: Initial frontend display showed No statistics available yet. This was debugged by creating sample data and then identifying and fixing a bug where the  function was called before the  state was properly populated.
2.  ** API Mismatch**: An error  was reported. This was fixed by changing  to  to match the actual utility function.
3.  **Incorrect Payment Calculation**: The user reported that the displayed earnings numbers were too high. This led to an iterative debugging process of the payment formula:
    *   Initially, it was thought the payment was a fixed . The backend was updated accordingly, and new sample data generated.
    *   The user then clarified that payment is hourly and *depends on the GPU type* (e.g., RTX 3090 is ). The  model and  function in  were updated to incorporate .
    *   Despite these changes, the numbers were still wrong. A final web scraping of  revealed the *actual* hourly rate for NVIDIA 3090 is .

The current state is that the correct hourly rate for NVIDIA 3090 () has been identified, and the AI engineer is about to apply this to the payment calculation logic.

<optional_next_step>
Update the backend's  function and related logic to use the newly identified GPU-specific hourly rates from Nosana markets, specifically  for RTX 3090.
