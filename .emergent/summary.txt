The AI engineer continued enhancing the Nosana Node Monitor application, building upon its initial MVP. The trajectory details a significant focus on security hardening, implementing rate limiting, input sanitization, and robust error handling across both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React). Subsequently, the engineer tackled UI/UX refinements, improving mobile responsiveness, introducing a theme selector with Dark Mode and a dynamic Cyber (formerly Cyberpunk) theme, complete with Matrix-like visual effects. Critical bug fixes included addressing Google sign-in post-security changes and resolving auto-logout issues. The final major feature added was a Firebase-based push notification system for node status changes, which is now fully functional. The current task involves comprehensive production-level testing.

<product_requirements>
The application monitors Nosana AI network nodes, providing online/offline status, job status, and alerts.
**Initial Implementation Summary:**
The application already features automated node and job status fetching (Solana blockchain, Nosana dashboard web scraping), UI enhancements (hide/show node addresses, PWA, dynamic theme switcher - initially 80s neon, then Nosana green pixelated, now Dark Mode and Cyber), auto-refresh with notifications, and detailed node information (balances, availability). A robust authentication system with email/password and Google OAuth ensures data privacy, allowing users to manage only their own nodes.
**Recent Enhancements:**
1.  **Comprehensive Security:** Implemented backend rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers, and improved frontend input validation and XSS protection.
2.  **PWA Favicon:** Replaced the default globe icon with a custom Nosana-themed server icon.
3.  **App Stability:** Addressed issues causing the app to go offline or auto-logout due to preview environment auto-sleep, implementing keep-alive pings and improved error handling.
4.  **Auto-Refresh Customization:** Added a customizable auto-refresh interval selector (1, 2, 3, 10 minutes).
5.  **Mobile UI Layout:** Corrected overlapping header controls on mobile devices.
6.  **Theming Improvements:** Renamed Modern Blue to Dark Mode, refined the Nosana theme colors, and introduced a new Cyber (formerly Cyberpunk) theme with green accents and a Matrix-like background.
7.  **Push Notifications:** Implemented Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time mobile push notifications on node status changes (offline/online, job started/completed), with user-selectable event triggers, vibration, and sound toggles.

<current_work>
The immediate work preceding this summary was the comprehensive implementation of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications and significant UI/UX enhancements, including dynamic theming and mobile responsiveness.

Specifically, the AI engineer:
1.  **Implemented Push Notifications:**
    *   **Backend:** Integrated  library, stored user-provided Firebase credentials in , defined notification subscription models and API endpoints (, , ) in . Modified the  endpoint to send real-time notifications via FCM when a node's status changes (offline, online, job started, job completed).
    *   **Frontend:** Installed Firebase SDK, created  for configuration, and  for the service worker. Added notification-related states and functions to , including requesting permissions, subscribing to push notifications, and managing user preferences. A Settings modal was introduced for users to customize notification triggers, sound, and vibration.
    *   **Bug Fix:** Resolved a critical issue where the frontend failed to subscribe to notifications due to incorrect service worker registration timing by updating  in .
2.  **Addressed App Stability & UX:**
    *   Fixed auto-logout issues caused by the preview environment's auto-sleep, implementing keep-alive pings to the backend and refining the  interceptor logic to differentiate network errors from authentication errors.
    *   Introduced a customizable auto-refresh interval selector (1, 2, 3, 10 minutes) in the UI.
    *   Corrected mobile layout issues for header controls (logout, theme selector, refresh selector) that were overlapping.
    *   Enhanced theming by renaming Modern Blue to Dark Mode, and implementing a Cyber theme (renamed from Cyberpunk) with green accents and a Matrix-like falling code background effect, along with a theme selection dropdown and a Moon icon for the theme button.
3.  **Current Task:** The last action taken was preparing for comprehensive production-level testing of the entire application, starting with updating  with new testing requirements, and then invoking the backend testing agent.
