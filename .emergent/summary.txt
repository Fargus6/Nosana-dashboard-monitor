This trajectory details an extensive development cycle, commencing with comprehensive backend and frontend production testing. The AI engineer addressed a frontend testability issue by adding  attributes to the theme selector. Subsequent work focused on diverse user requests: iterative logo redesigns with specific aesthetic and textual modifications (e.g., N shape, Nosana Node Monitor text, green palette), intricate color adjustments for the Cyber theme (white text for node names, buttons, eye icons, labels), and critical app stability fixes including PWA auto-update mechanisms and enhanced  pings to prevent auto-logout. Key bug fixes included correcting job-started notification triggers and updating password field hints. The trajectory also covered automated daily testing setup via cron jobs, clarifying subscription expiry implications, and a detailed plan for an AI support agent (deferred). Finally, the engineer optimized notifications for lock-screen visibility and thoroughly updated the  file.

The application, Nosana Node Monitor, is designed to monitor Nosana AI network nodes, displaying their online/offline status, job status, and offering alerts.

**Current State & User Problem:**
The app, initially an MVP, has undergone significant enhancements. It features automated node/job status fetching, a robust authentication system (email/password, Google OAuth), PWA capabilities, and a dynamic theme switcher (now including Dark Mode and Cyber). Recent focus has been on comprehensive security (rate limiting, input sanitization), app stability (keep-alive pings, improved error handling), customizable auto-refresh intervals, and mobile UI/UX refinements. A major feature is Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notifications for node status changes, with user-configurable triggers.

**User's Recent Requests & Implemented Solutions:**
1.  **Automated Testing**: Implement daily automated tests for backend and frontend functionality. (Implemented: Cron jobs, shell scripts for daily tests)
2.  **Logo Redesign**: Iteratively refine the app logo, including specific design elements like an N shape, Nosana green color, curved text (Nosana Node Monitor), and various formats. (Implemented: Multiple logo iterations in SVG, PNG, JPEG formats, updated favicons).
3.  **Cyber Theme UI**: Change node names, + Add New Node button, eye icons, and various text labels to white in the Cyber theme for better visibility. (Implemented:  theme configuration updated for white text).
4.  **App Stability**: Ensure servers do not go to sleep and prevent auto-logout. (Implemented: Fixed  endpoint prefix, refined  interceptor, improved  logic, confirmed keep-alive pings).
5.  **Password Field Hint**: Correct password field suggestion from min 6 characters to min 8 characters. (Implemented: Frontend placeholder text updated, backend/frontend validation confirmed at 8 chars).
6.  **Job Started Notifications**: Fix notifications for job started events, as they were not appearing correctly. (Implemented: Backend  logic updated to include 'queue' status transition).
7.  **Hidden Status Display**: Addresses and balances should be visible by default, not hidden. (Implemented: Default visibility for addresses/balances in  removed).
8.  **PWA Auto-Update**: Enable automatic app updates without requiring users to log out, delete, and reinstall. (Implemented: Generic , update detection in , Update Available button,  updates).
9.  **Registration Rate Limit**: Increase registration limit from 5 to 30 per hour and provide a custom message when the cap is reached. (Implemented:  rate limit updated, custom  handler, frontend message enhancement).
10. **Lock Screen Notifications**: Ensure notifications appear on locked screens and light up the phone immediately. (Implemented:  and  updated with higher priority and specific options for lock screen display and screen wake-up).
11. **Documentation Updates**: Update  with new features, web UI link, and remove outdated sections. (Implemented:  updated and pruned as requested).

<current_work>
The immediate work preceding this summary was the comprehensive implementation of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications and significant UI/UX enhancements, including dynamic theming and mobile responsiveness.

Specifically, the AI engineer had:
1.  **Implemented Push Notifications:** Integrated  in the backend (), storing credentials in . Defined API endpoints for notification subscriptions/preferences. Modified  to send real-time FCM notifications. On the frontend, installed Firebase SDK, created  and , and added notification states/functions to  with a Settings modal.
2.  **Addressed App Stability & UX:** Fixed auto-logout by implementing keep-alive pings and refining  interceptor. Introduced a customizable auto-refresh interval selector. Corrected mobile layout issues for header controls. Enhanced theming by renaming Modern Blue to Dark Mode, refining Nosana theme, and introducing Cyber theme with Matrix-like effects.

**Work during this trajectory focused on:**
*   Comprehensive production testing (backend and frontend), fixing a frontend testability issue with theme selector  attributes.
*   Iterative logo redesigns, including a N shape, Nosana green colors, curved text, and generation in various formats.
*   Extensive Cyber theme color adjustments to ensure elements like node names, buttons, and icons are white.
*   Further app stability enhancements by fixing  prefix for  endpoint and improving  function to prevent accidental auto-logout.
*   Correcting the password field hint from min 6 characters to min 8 characters and verifying validation.
*   Fixing job started notifications by updating the backend logic to include nodes transitioning from 'queue' to 'running'.
*   Implementing a PWA auto-update system to ensure new features are delivered without reinstallation.
*   Increasing the registration rate limit to 30/hour with a custom user-friendly error message.
*   Enabling lock-screen notifications with higher priority, screen wake-up, and strong vibration patterns.
*   Setting up automated daily backend and frontend testing via cron jobs.
*   Changing the default behavior of addresses and balances to be visible, not hidden.
*   Thoroughly updating and cleaning the  file to reflect all new features and remove outdated sections.
